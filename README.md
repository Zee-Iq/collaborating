# Collabs

**Instructions**: 
* Create one repository on github named "collaborating" with a partner. 
* Add: 
    - a short bio of themselves, 
    - a recipe, 
    - a definition of a word 
to the readme of the repo.
* On separate branches, you should both make these changes to the readme. 
* Then, make a pull request for both of your branches. 
* Assign one another to review your work. Once you have reviewed each other's work, merge the branches to master.
